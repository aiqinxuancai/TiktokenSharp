# TiktokenSharp

Due to the lack of a C# version of `cl100k_base` encoding (gpt-3.5-turbo), I have implemented a basic solution with encoding and decoding methods based on the official Rust implementation.

Currently, `cl100k_base` `p50k_base` has been implemented. Other encodings will be added in future submissions. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to submit them on the `lssues`."

If you want to use the ChatGPT C# library that integrates this repository and implements context-based conversation, please visit [ChatGPTSharp](https://github.com/aiqinxuancai/ChatGPTSharp).

## Getting Started

TiktokenSharp is available as [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TiktokenSharp/).

```csharp
using TiktokenSharp;

//use model name
TikToken tikToken = TikToken.EncodingForModel("gpt-3.5-turbo");
var i = tikToken.Encode("hello world"); //[15339, 1917]
var d = tikToken.Decode(i); //hello world

//use encoding name
TikToken tikToken = TikToken.GetEncoding("cl100k_base");
var i = tikToken.Encode("hello world"); //[15339, 1917]
var d = tikToken.Decode(i); //hello world
```

**When using a new encoder for the first time, the required tiktoken files for the encoder will be downloaded from the internet. This may take some time.** Once the download is successful, subsequent uses will not require downloading again. You can set `TikToken.PBEFileDirectory` before using the encoder to modify the storage path of the downloaded tiktoken files, or you can pre-download the files to avoid network issues causing download failures.

**Why are the tiktoken files not integrated into the package?** On one hand, this would make the package size larger. On the other hand, I want to stay as consistent as possible with OpenAI's official Python code.

If you are deploying cloud functions, such as "Azure App Service," which cannot read/write local files, please package tiktoken files(PBE Dir) with the publish files.

## Benchmark Test

I noticed that some users would like to get a comparison of efficiency. Here, I use SharpToken as the basic comparison, with the encoder cl100k_base, on the .Net 6.0 in Debug mode.
* TiktokenSharp Version: 1.1.0 
* SharpToken Version: 2.0.1

```csharp
private GptEncoding _sharpToken = GptEncoding.GetEncoding("cl100k_base");
private TikToken _tikToken = TikToken.GetEncoding("cl100k_base");

private string _kLongText = "King Lear, one of Shakespeare's darkest and most savage plays, tells the story of the foolish and Job-like Lear, who divides his kingdom, as he does his affections, according to vanity and whim. Lear’s failure as a father engulfs himself and his world in turmoil and tragedy.";
